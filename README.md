1. To form a test sample of images from https://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/;
2. Calculate the following characteristics:
        1. Maximum / minimum value;
        2. Mathematical expectation and variance;
        3. Median values, interquartile range;
        4. asymmetry and kurtosis (normalized);
3. Build a histogram of pixel brightness values;
4. Determine the best fit;
5. Build a list of the types of probabilistic distributions used 
for which have a minimum value of the approximation error.
